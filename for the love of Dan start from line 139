#16)a) Create a list that represents a set of students. The list should contain the following
#students: Clark,Horan,Rai,White,Cooper,Jones,Cox,Smith (4 marks)

#tudents = ["Clark", "Horan", "Rai", "White", "Cooper", "Jones", "Cox", "Smith"]

#b) use a method to order the students so that they are in alphabetical order (3 marks)

#students.sort()
#print (students)

#17) create a tuple that represents exam marks with the following data. (4 marks)
#These are the respective exam marks for the alphabetically ordered student list
# 65,66,67,80,90,65,65,93

#marks = (65,66,67,80,90,65,65,93)

#18) Dictionary question (9 marks)
#create a dictionary which joins the student with their corresponding mark. 
#There is a manual way of doing this or a way involving using the previous tuple and list
#you will be awarded highest marks for 

#student_marks = (dict(zip(students,marks)))

#print (student_marks)

#Sir Isaac Newton created the three laws of motion. The second of these laws 
#links force with mass and acceleration. The formula is as follows:
#Force = Mass x Acceleration. Force is measured in Newtons
#Write a function called calcForc which takes two arguments (Mass and Acceleration) and returns
# the product of these two arguments
#Therefore a call of calcForce(500,2) should returnn 1000
#Give the default acceleration as 9.81 (Gravity). a call of calcForce(100) should return 981

#def calforc (mass, acel = 9.81):
    #force = mass * acel
    #return force

#print (calforc (500,2))

#4.5.1 Sample functions: Evaluating the BMI
#Let's get started on a function to evaluate the Body Mass Index (BMI).

#As you can see, the formula gets two values:

#weight (originally in kilograms)
#height (originally in meters)
#It seems that this new function will have two parameters. Its name will be bmi, but if you prefer any other name, use it instead.


#def bmi (weight, height):
        #calbmi= weight/height **2
        #return calbmi

#print (bmi(52.5,1.65))

#Question: Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list. 
#For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the function should return 12 (which is the sum of 2, 4, and 6).

#Feel free to write the code to solve this problem.



#def sum_of_events (numbers):
    #even_sum = 0
    #for number in numbers:
        #if number % 2 ==0:
            #even_sum += number
    #return sum_of_events


# Example usage:
#numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#result = sum_of_events(numbers)
#print(result)  # Output will be 12

#Question: Write a Python function called is_even that takes an integer as an argument and returns True if the number is even and False 
#if it's odd.

#Here's a template to help you get started:

#def is_even (number):
    #if number % 2 ==0:
        #print ("Even number")

    #else:
        #print ("odd number")


#number = (int(input("enter a number? ")))
#is_even(number)

#Question: Write a Python function called count_vowels that takes a string as an argument and returns the count of vowels 
#(both uppercase and lowercase) in the string. 
#For this exercise, consider 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' as vowels.

#def count_vowels (word):
    #counter = 0
    #for letter in word:

#print (count_vowels(word))

#Question: Write a Python program that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list 
#containing only the even numbers from the original list. You should use a list comprehension to achieve this.

#For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], your program should return [2, 4, 6].


#def even_filter (list_of_numbers):
    #new_list= []
    #for number in list_of_numbers:
        #if number %2 ==0:

#print ("list of even numbers", even_filter(numbers))

#Question: Write Python code to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and then print the result.

#You should use a loop (e.g., for or while) to iterate through the numbers and accumulate the sum. Here's a template to get you started:

#sum = 0
#for number in range (101):
    #if number % 2 ==0:
        #sum += number

#print (sum)

#Question: Write a Python expression to calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 5 units.

#What is the area of the rectangle?

#Please calculate and provide the answer.

#Question: Write a Python program to generate a list of all even numbers from 10 to 30 (inclusive) 
#using the range function and then calculate the sum of these even numbers.

#Please write the Python code to generate the list and calculate the sum, and provide the answer.



#even_num = list(range(10,31,2))
