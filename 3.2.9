#The break statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.

#Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters #"chupacabra" as the secret exit word, in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." should be printed #to the screen, and the loop should terminate.

#Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

#Receive a guess from the user and set variable.
guess = str(input("I have a secret word, what do you think it is:"))
#Set the secret word variable
secret_word = str("chupacabra")
#While loop to check if guess is correct
while guess != secret_word:
    guess = input("That's not the secret word, guess again!:")#If guess is not correct do this, it will change the guess variable to the new input and check again.
    if guess == secret_word:#If guess is correct, break out of the loop
        break
print("You have guessed correctly", secret_word,"is the secret word!")#and print this message
