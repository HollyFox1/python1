    if i not in unique_list: #If the value is NOT in the unique list:-
        unique_list.append(i) #It is added to the unique list
        unique_list.sort() #this just puts the list in numerical order, it is not needed.

#I made the final print show more info, this is not required. A simple print("The list with unique elements only:", unique_list) will work fine.
