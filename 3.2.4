#task is to help the magician complete the code in the editor 
#in such a way so that the code:

#will ask the user to enter an interger number;
#will use a while loop 
#will check whether the number entered by the user is the same 
#as the number picked by the magician.
 
secret_number = 777
x = int(input("enter your guess"))

#If the number chosen by the user is different than the magician's 
#secret number, the user should see the message "Ha ha!#You're stuck
# in my loop!"and be prompted to enter a number again.

while x != secret_number
    print("haha You're stuck in my loop!")


#If the number entered by the user matches the number picked by 
#the magician, the number should be printed to the screen,
#and the magician should say the following words:
# "Well done, muggle! You are free now."

else:
    print("Well done you guessed correct!", secret_number,"was my secret number!")
