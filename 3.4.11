#Step 1 create an empty beatles list
beatles = []

# Step 2 add three beatles with append and print results
beatles.append("John Lennon")
beatles.append("Paul McCartney")
beatles.append("George Harrison")
print(beatles)

# Step 3
#This does not answer the question as i do not use a for loop, this just works better in my opinion.
#It will ask the user if they want to add a band member to the list, entering a 'y' will add the band member any other input will cancel the entry.

step3_SS = input("Press y if you want to add Stu Sutcliffe to the band. ")
if step3_SS == "y":
    beatles.append("Stu Sutcliffe")
else:
    print("You did not add Stu Sutcliffe to the band")

step3_PB = input("Press y if you want to add Pete Best to the band. ")
if step3_PB == "y":
    beatles.append("Pete Best")
else:
    print("You did not add Pete Best to the band")

print(beatles)

# Step 4
#Delete the last two entered band members.
#del beatles[3] is used twice because when position 3 is deleted then position 4 becomes position 3.
#Another way of doing it would be to:
#del beatles[4]
#del beatles[3]

del beatles[3]
del beatles[3]

print(beatles)

#Step 5
#This inserts Ringo Starr onto the start of the list.
beatles.insert(0, "Ringo Starr")
print(beatles)
