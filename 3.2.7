#Do you know what Mississippi is? Well, it's the name of one of the states and rivers in the United States. The #Mississippi River is about 2,340 miles long, which makes it the second longest river in the United States (the longest #being the Missouri River). It's so long that a single drop of water needs 90 days to travel its entire length!

#The word Mississippi is also used for a slightly different purpose: to count mississippily.

#If you're not familiar with the phrase, we're here to explain to you what it means: it's used to count seconds.

#The idea behind it is that adding the word Mississippi to a number when counting seconds aloud makes them sound closer #to clock-time, and therefore "one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi" will take approximately an actual #three seconds of time! It's often used by children playing hide-and-seek to make sure the seeker does an honest count.

#Your task is very simple here: write a program that uses a for loop to "count mississippily" to five. Having counted #to five, the program should print to the screen the final message "Ready or not, here I come!"

#Note that the code in the editor contains two elements which may not be fully clear to you at this moment: the import time statement, and the sleep() method. We're going to talk about them soon.

import time #This will import the built in time module, this is required to use time.sleep() below.
#For loop to count in mississippi's from 1 to 5, with a 1 second pause.
for i in range(0,5):
    i += 1 #Increment i by 1
    print(i,"Mississippi") #Print the value in i followed by Mississippi
    time.sleep(1) #Make the loop sleep for 1 second this will slow the count down to one Mississippi per second.
